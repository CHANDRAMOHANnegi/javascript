 * 
 * 2 pointer vs SLIDING WINDOW
 * 
 *  Sliding window algorithms can be implemented with a single pointer and a variable for window size.
 *  Typically we use all of the elements within the window for the problem (for eg - sum of all elements in the window).
 *  Two pointer technique is quite similar but we usually compare the value at the two pointers instead of all the elements between the pointers.
 *  Two pointers can also have variations like fast-slow pointer.
