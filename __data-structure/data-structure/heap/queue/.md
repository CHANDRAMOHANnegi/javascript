Why Negative Means Higher Priority

1. In programming, negative numbers often mean "first comes before second."
2. If you think of sorting:
   A comparator returning < 0 places the first element before the second.
   Similarly, in a heap, < 0 means "this element is prioritized over the other."

2. Role of the Comparator Function
   The comparator is a function that decides the priority between two elements. It returns:
    A negative number (< 0) if the first element has higher priority.
    A positive number (> 0) if the second element has higher priority.
    0 if both elements have equal priority.
