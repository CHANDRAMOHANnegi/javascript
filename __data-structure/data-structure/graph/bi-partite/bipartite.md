- neighbor nodes should be in different sets
- if adjacent nodes have same levels then its not bipartite

divided into two disjoint sets

level of nbr should not be same as level of parent


1. Every non-cyclic graph is bipartite
2. if all cycle of even length, then bi-partite
3. if any odd-length cycles then not bi-partite
