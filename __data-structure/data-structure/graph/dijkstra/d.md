Dijkstra's algorithm is a computer science algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It's based on the Greedy Algorithm and is used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.

/***
 * 
* Dijkstra algorithm is same as BFS,
* we just have to use priority-queue in place of queue
* 
* priority queue, jiski priority jyada usko pehle bahar nikalti hai,
* ya jiski value kam, use pehle bahar nikalti hai
* 
* get distances of all other nodes from the start node
* we have as distances object which will be updated
* 
* ***/



* of all the nodes we will be adding the node with most priority to our network
