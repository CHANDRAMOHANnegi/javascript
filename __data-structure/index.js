 * ******************* HOW TO APPROACH A PROBLEM ****************
 * 
 * 1. Read question 2 times properly
 * 2. Repeat step 1 again
 * 
 * 3. Relax, calm down
 * 
 * 4. Don't jump into solution, I repeat don't jump to code
 * 
 * 5. Think what question wants, YOU don't know answer, don't assume
 * 
 * 6. Think again
 * 
 * 7. write approach algo
 * 
 * *******************
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Don't just try to go to best solution in first step, first try solve it by any method, then go for optimization
 * 
 * 
 * ********************* SOME COMMON *********************
 * ********************* SOME COMMON *********************
 * 
 * 1. Can `map` be used to solve it, this can be very useful
 *      use extras space to solve problem
 * 
 * 2. When working with linked list try using dummy-nodes
 * 3. In linked list remember removing unwanted connections to avoid cycles
