Let's examine the exact sequence for combined leading and trailing throttle (leading: true, trailing: true) with a 10ms throttle period:

### Events Timeline

- A: 0ms
- B: 7ms
- C: 12ms
- D: 22ms
- E: 25ms
- F: 45ms

### Leading + Trailing Throttle (leading: true, trailing: true)

1. **Event A (0ms)**:

   - ✓ EXECUTES immediately (leading is true)
   - Starts 10ms throttle period (0ms to 10ms)
   - During this period, events are collected but not immediately executed

2. **Event B (7ms)**:

   - Collected during throttle period (not executed immediately)
   - Becomes the "latest" event in the current throttle period

3. **At 10ms mark (end of first throttle period)**:

   - ✓ EXECUTES B (the most recent event during the period)
   - First throttle period ends

4. **Event C (12ms)**:

   - Outside any active throttle period
   - ✓ EXECUTES immediately (leading is true)
   - Starts a new 10ms throttle period (12ms to 22ms)

5. **At 22ms mark (end of second throttle period)**:

   - No events occurred between 12ms and 22ms
   - No trailing execution happens (no events to execute)

6. **Event D (22ms)**:

   - Occurs right as the previous throttle period ends
   - ✓ EXECUTES immediately (leading is true)
   - Starts a new 10ms throttle period (22ms to 32ms)

7. **Event E (25ms)**:

   - Collected during throttle period (not executed immediately)
   - Becomes the "latest" event in the current throttle period

8. **At 32ms mark (end of third throttle period)**:

   - ✓ EXECUTES E (the most recent event during the period)
   - Throttle period ends

9. **Event F (45ms)**:

   - Outside any active throttle period
   - ✓ EXECUTES immediately (leading is true)
   - Starts a new 10ms throttle period (45ms to 55ms)

10. **At 55ms mark (end of fourth throttle period)**:
    - No events occurred between 45ms and 55ms
    - No trailing execution happens (no events to execute)

**Final execution sequence: A, B, C, D, E, F**

With leading+trailing throttle, we get both immediate execution of the first event in a "burst" AND execution of the last event in each throttle period. This provides both immediate feedback and ensures the most recent data is processed before the period ends.

This combined approach results in the most function executions of all three throttling strategies, which makes sense because it's designed to provide both immediate responsiveness and final-state handling.
