For the trailing throttle (leading: false, trailing: true) with a 10ms throttle period, let's analyze exactly how these events would be processed:

### Events Timeline

- A: 0ms
- B: 7ms
- C: 12ms
- D: 22ms
- E: 25ms
- F: 45ms

### Trailing Throttle (leading: false, trailing: true)

1. **Event A (0ms)**:

   - No immediate execution (leading is false)
   - Start 10ms throttle period
   - Save A for potential execution at 10ms

2. **Event B (7ms)**:

   - Still in first throttle period
   - Replace A with B as the candidate for execution
   - B is now scheduled for execution at 10ms

3. **At 10ms mark**:

   - ✓ Execute B (the most recent event during the period)
   - First throttle period ends

4. **Event C (12ms)**:

   - Start a new 10ms throttle period
   - Save C for potential execution at 22ms

5. **Event D (22ms)**:

   - ✓ Execute C (from previous period)
   - Start a new 10ms throttle period
   - Save D for potential execution at 32ms

6. **Event E (25ms)**:

   - Still in throttle period started by D
   - Replace D with E as the candidate for execution
   - E is now scheduled for execution at 32ms

7. **At 32ms mark**:

   - ✓ Execute E (the most recent event during the period)
   - Throttle period ends

8. **Event F (45ms)**:

   - This is after all previous throttle periods
   - Start a new 10ms throttle period
   - Schedule F for execution at 55ms

9. **At 55ms mark**:
   - ✓ Execute F

**Final execution sequence: B, C, E, F**

With trailing throttle, the key pattern is that execution happens at the end of each throttle period, and if multiple events occur during a period, only the last one is executed.
