<!-- 

 Each item is originally 100px wide, but since the container is only 150px, both items shrink to fit.
 The default value of flex-shrink is 1, which means that flex items can shrink if there isn't enough space in the flex container.

 Flexbox prioritizes flexibility over fixed sizing. If items don't behave as expected, control them using flex-grow, flex-shrink, and align-items.
