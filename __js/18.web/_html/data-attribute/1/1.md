Difference between element.style and window.getComputedStyle(element):

This property reflects the inline styles of the element, i.e., styles that are directly set in the HTML using the style attribute or via JavaScript.

It only returns styles that are explicitly applied to the element inline. It does not return styles applied via external stylesheets or inherited styles.
