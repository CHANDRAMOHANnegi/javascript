// 1. The forEach method in JavaScript is designed to loop through all elements of an array and does not respect a return statement to exit early. 

// 2. Even if you use return inside the forEach callback function, it only returns from the callback function and not from the parent function. 

// 3. This means that if you're trying to return early (as in the case where you find a valid path), it won't stop the loop or return early from the outer function.
