 * 3. Relax, calm down
 * 
 * 4. Don't jump into solution, I repeat don't jump to code
 * 
 * 5. Think what question wants, YOU don't know answer, don't assume
 * 
 * 6. Think again
 * 
 * *******************
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Don't just try to go to best solution in first step, first try solve it by any method, then go for optimization
 *

 * 
 * 1. Can `map` be used to solve it, this can be very useful
