StopPropagation :
stopPropagation prevents any further propagation of the event in the bubbling phase.

PreventDefault :
preventDefault is used to prevent the default action associated with an event from occurring. For example, clicking a link navigates to a new page, and submitting a form refreshes the page. If you want to prevent these default actions from happening, you'd use preventDefault.
