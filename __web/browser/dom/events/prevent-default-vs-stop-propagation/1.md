stopPropagation prevents any further propagation of the event in the bubbling phase.

PreventDefault :
preventDefault is used to prevent the default action associated with an event from occurring. For example, 

1.clicking a link navigates to a new page 

2.submitting a form refreshes the page. 

If you want to prevent these default actions from happening, you'd use preventDefault.
