Loading CSS files can not only block HTML code parsing, but also prevent JavaScript code from executing.


JavaScript `<script>` tags were often placed in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
However, doing so means that the parsing of the HTML is blocked until the JavaScript file is fetched and executed,
leading to slower page load times.

1. Async
   1. Async downloads the script while DOM is parsing and only pauses the DOM for execution of the script.
   2. Follows "load first order", means if s second script loads before first script, then second will execute first
   3. that's why we should not use async when there is dependency on other script

2. Defer
   Defer downloads the script while the DOM is still parsing but executes them only after the parsing is finished.
